            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Trace's Salon was born from a passion for beauty and a desire to create a space where people feel truly cared for. Founded by Tracie Holden, a stylist with over ten years of experience in the beauty industry, the salon represents the culmination of Tracie's lifelong dream to offer personalized beauty services in a welcoming and vibrant environment.</p>
                <p>After years of working with clients and honing her craft, Tracie realized that there was a gap in the local community for a salon that focused not only on the art of hair styling but also on building meaningful connections with clients. She wanted a place where people could come as they are, express themselves, and leave feeling empowered and refreshed.</p>
                <p>In 2025, that dream became a reality when Trace's Salon opened its doors on Main Street. Tracie handpicked a team of talented professionals who share her vision of providing exceptional service in a relaxed and approachable setting. Together, they created a salon that offers more than just beauty treatments—it's a sanctuary where clients can unwind, recharge, and leave feeling their absolute best.</p>
                <p>The name Trace's Salon is a personal tribute to Tracie's roots and a nod to the mark she wants to leave on her clients—one of confidence, style, and self-care. Every detail of the salon was carefully crafted to reflect Tracie's values of quality, authenticity, and care, from the modern design to the handpicked products and services that ensure each visit is a unique experience.</p>
                <p>What began as a passion for beauty has now transformed into a beloved local business that brings together the best of style, service, and community. As Trace's Salon continues to grow, Tracie and her team remain committed to making every client feel like they're the most important person in the room.</p></summary>
